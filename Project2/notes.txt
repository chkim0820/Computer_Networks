-   I tried implementing chunked encoding, but it messed up the code I had before.
    Here is a link to what I had before reverting the code back: https://bin.birdflop.com/nabucazaki.cpp
    The code doesn't work, but I would appreciate it if it could be considered for extra credit if it is possible.
        -   If it deducts more points, please just discard... The code is quite messy.
-   Thanks!
