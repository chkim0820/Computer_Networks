Description: To be considered during grading process.

 -  I am aware that each measurement should have thousands of data points, and two of my measurements (packet loss and retransmission) are technically 'countable-by-hands' small. However, I still included them as separate measurements because their values, which I am working with here, are the results gathered from thousands of transmissions over time. Plus, I found both of them to be useful measurements for gauging network performances. I am hoping that they can be counted as separate, valid measurements.
     -  I also confirmed my plans and details regarding the measurements with the TAs and Professor Allman via email prior to taking the measurements. So I am hoping they are not going to be unexpected troubles.
